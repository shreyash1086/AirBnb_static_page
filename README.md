# AirBnb Static Web Page

## About the Project
Started learning React and built a basic **static webpage** as a practice project.

React is an easier way to write normal HTML/CSS/JS.  

It is a new syntax that, under the hood, gets converted into HTML/CSS/JS.

While learning, I have studied and implemented the React concepts such as `State` and `Component`.

## React Concepts Learned

##### STATE  
It is a JavaScript object that represents the current state of the app.

##### COMPONENTS    
How a DOM element should render, given a state.  
It is a reusable, dynamic snippet that changes given the state.

#### My Little Analogy
In React, a component is like a 'human body' that represents the current structure and behavior.  
State acts like 'nourishment', and whenever the state (nourishment) changes, the component (body) adapts and re-renders to reflect the new state.

#### JSX
- JavaScript XML.
- It allows us to write HTML-like code in JavaScript.
- React uses JSX to describe what the UI should look like.
- It allows us to mix HTML and JavaScript together easily.
- Babel converts the JSX into normal JS, which can be understood by React.

#### React Folder Structure
- Learned about the React folder structure which consists of **node_modules, public, src**.
- The **src** folder is the most important folder in a React application. It contains the most important code files of the application such as `index.js`.
- The `index.js` file sends all its data to an `index.html` file, which is available in the public folder, in order to render the application on a browser.
