Started Learning React.  

React is just a easier way to write normal HTML/CSS/JS.  
It is a new Syntax that under the hood get converted into HTML/CSS/JS.

While learning I have Studied and Implemented the React concepts such as `State` and `Component`.

##### STATE  
  It is an JavaScript Object that represents current state of the App.  

##### COMPONENTS    
How a DOM element should Render, given a State.  
It is a reusable, Dynami snippet that changes given the State.   

#### My little analogy
  In React, a Component is like a 'human body' that represents current structure and behaviour.  
  State act like 'nourishment' and whenever the State(nourishment) changes the Component(body) adapts and re-render to reflect new State. 

#### JSX
  - JavaScript XML.
  - It allows us to write HTML like code in JavaScript.
  - React uses JSX to describe what UI should look like.
  - It allows us to Mix HTML and JavaScript togather easily
  - Babel converts the JSX into normal JS, which can be understood by React
